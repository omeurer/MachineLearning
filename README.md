# MachineLearning
This folder contains my projects of Machine Learning â€” mainly implementing from scratch all algorithms and classes to understand their in and out. 

1. [Regression and Bike Forecast:](https://github.com/omeurer/MachineLearning/blob/main/REGRESSION_AND_BIKE_FORECAST.ipynb)
   This notebook implements from scratch : linear regression, polynomial regression, gradient descent, ridge, lasso and robust regression. It also shows the impact of the choice of hyperparameters and complexity according to the number of points chosen. It is concluded with the classic bicycle trips forecasting across Seattle's Fremont Bridge, using our built-from-scratch classes.
